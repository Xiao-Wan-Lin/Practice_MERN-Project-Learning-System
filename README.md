# MERN Project - Learning System
Use React.js as the frontend framework, and Node.js and MongoDB as the backend server

# Introdution
Users have two types of identities
1. **Students**: They can register for an account and log in. After logging in, they can view course information and register for their favorite courses
2. **Instructors**: They can register for an account and log in. After logging in, they can create courses and view the courses they have created, as well as the number of students registered for those courses

# The technologies used
Write using the MVC pattern
## React
- **React Router** : Used for client-side routing management to implement a Single Page Application (SPA)
- **State Management** : Manage and monitor application state using useState and useEffect
- **Component-Based Development** : Develop pages and features using a component-based approach

## Backend
- **Express** : Use the Express framework to set up the server more quickly
- **RESTful API** : Build a RESTful API that includes user registration, login, and courses management
- **MongoDB** : Connect to the MongoDB database and use Mongoose for data model management
- **Bcrypt** : Encrypt user passwords for secure storage, ensuring password safety
- **Connect Flash** : Display success or failure messages for user actions
- **JWT** : Authenticate users through JWT(JSON Web Token)
